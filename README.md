This project uses an Arduino UNO, PN532 NFC/RFID controller breakout board, Powerswitch Tail II to create a key card controlled power outlet.

I have attached a 32x32 LED arrray that uses a bluetooth connection to read video off an Android tablet camera that will turn on when the correct keycard is swiped.
