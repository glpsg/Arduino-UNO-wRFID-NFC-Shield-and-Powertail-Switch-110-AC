This project uses an Arduino UNO, PN532 NFC/RFID controller breakout board, Powerswitch Tail II to create a RFID/NFC key card controlled power outlet.

I have attached a 32x32 LED arrray to the key card controlled power outlet that uses a bluetooth connection to transmit video from an Android tablet camera.
